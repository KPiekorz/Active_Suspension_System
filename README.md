# Active Suspension System

## System description 

A system that allows for adaptive control of the suspension of a modern BMW or AUDI electric car (mock different sensor and components of system, which allow to simulate it).

## System requirements

- 

## System operation assumption

- System handles multiple processes at once
- System reacts to external events with a deternimist delay, which is very short;

## System functionalities

- Change hardness/stiffness of the suspension;
- Preventing the car from tilting when turning;
- Change of the suspension hardness depending on the quality of the surface, on which the car is moving (detected with accelerometer, sonar);
- Simulation environment (ROS and Gazebo), in which the operation of the system will be presented in practice

## System structure and architecture

## Used sensor

- Camera
- Heigh sensor
- Acccel
- Gyro
- Stearing
- Speed sensor
